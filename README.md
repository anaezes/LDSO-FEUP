# U.Openlab: Transparent Bidding Platform with Blockchain Strategies

The  U.Openlab  concept  is  developed  at  the  University  of  Porto  (U.Porto)  in  the  context  of  the
teaching/learning  process  and  is  assumed  to  be  an  interaction  facilitator  platform  between  real
-world needs  and  practical  works  topics.  The  aim  is  to  provide  innovative  answers  and  the  effective  use  of assessment  results,  the  credits  recognition  for  future  professional  or  scientific  careers  and  a sustainable process oriented for, among others, universities heritage services' needs.

The pilot-project in course at the University of Porto, focusing on the U.Porto Digital Museum, includes
a  technological  infrastructure with  three  main  components:  several  collections,  an  information  and
services  management  platform,  with  its  corresponding  digital  repository;  the  U.Porto  community
contributions  management  platform  (U.Porto  OpenLab);  and  an  adaptive  framework  that  will  support various interface applications with non-specific audiences.

The   U.Porto   OpenLab   considers   two   main   areas:   the   bidding   management   area   /   calls   for
contributions  and  a  contributions  personal  management  area.  The  professor,  the  student  and  the
“client”  are  the  actors  in  the  process.  As  for  main  tasks  we  point  out  the  reception,  selection  and distribution  of  real  needs  /  problems.  Having  concluded  the  assessment  process,  results  were
selected and an online publication was submitted. The inherent credits are recorded in a contributors'
digital portfolio management and in the professional social networks profiles.
The methodology will be presented and discussed as well as the process along with the obstacles and
other factors contributing to the success and future replication of this experience.

* open a terminal window inside the root folder
* run ```docker-compose up --build```
* you can run ```docker exec -t laravel_web_1 php artisan db:seed``` to re-seed the database, it is already done once at each execution
