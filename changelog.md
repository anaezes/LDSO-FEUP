## Increment description
The team worked on features prioritized by the POs, such as creating a team for bidding projects, adding auction functionality and viewing the profile page. Besides that, the team also improved the repository hygiene by removing certain unneeded files and adding them to the .gitignore files.

The sprint ended with a meeting with the PO who validated the issues for this iteration and approved the planned features for the next sprint.
